<title>Building Communication Skills</title>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Building Communication Skills</h1>
<p>Communication is a key aspect of human life, and being able to communicate effectively helps our psychological well-being for numerous reasons. It allows us to convey our needs and feelings, to respond and respect the needs of others, and to build significant relationships. To build these skills, we need to develop three interlinked skillsets, known as <strong>Assertiveness, Non-Verbal Communication, and Conversational Skills</strong>.</p>

<h2>Assertiveness<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573496546038-82f9c39f6365?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=869&q=80" alt="Two people talking" style="width:275px;height:160px;float:right;"></h2>
<p>One might ask, "What is assertiveness anyways?" Well to be assertive means to express your wants, needs, and opinions in a clear and confident way. One who struggles with being assertive may agree with a couple or more of these statements:<br><b>1.</b> You have difficulty saying "No" to people<br><b>2.</b> You keep things bottled up inside until you eventually blow up<br><b>3.</b> You are generally passive and rarely state your opinions<br><b>4.</b> You find that the only way to express your needs is by being aggressive<br><b>5.</b> You feel like others take advantage of you<br><b>6.</b> You eventually give in to others' wants<br><b>7.</b> You feel like you are not respected by others<br><b>8.</b> You have little to no self-respect because you don't communicate your needs or wants</p>
<p>When being assertive, make sure you speak in a calm, normal tone, and respect yourself and others. By becoming more assertive, you can more clearly express your needs and wants to others.</p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/assertive/art-20044644" target="_blank"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573497620053-ea5300f94f21?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80" style="width:280px;height:185px;" alt="Click to read an article on Assertiveness"></a>


<h2>Non-Verbal Communication</h2>
<p>Not only is your verbal communication important, but so is nonverbal communication. What we communicate with our bodies is a crucial part of effective communication, as they speak even louder than words. Nonverbal communication includes, but is not limited to:<b>
<br>Where we look
<br>Our body posture
<br>Our body movements
<br>The expression of our face
<br>The tone of our voice</b><br>During a conversation with someone, it is necessary to keep watch of these things. They can communicate your feelings, your interest in the matter, your knowledge of the subject, your attitude, and even your honesty. If you want to get better at communication is important to practice these nonverbal skills. First, you could try with friends or family. You could even try in front of a camera or mirror. Once you gain some confidence in this, try practicing with someone you are less familiar, like a distant classmate.<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543269865-cbf427effbad?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80" alt="Friends having a conversation" width="280" height="200" style="float:right"></p>


<h2>Conversation Skills</h2>
<p>Conversation skills are important, obviously, for starting and keeping conversations, but what else? By honing your conversation skills, you can make communication truly effective.</p>
<p>First things first, how do you start a conversation? Well, starting one with a friend or a relative might be easy, but how about everyone else? If you haven't met before, you'll want to start with a greeting, something like, <em>"Hello. I don't think we've met before. My name is ..."</em> Then, lead into a more general topic, like the news or the weather. Alternatively, you can say a compliment such as, <em>"I like your shirt."</em> All throughout, make sure to pay attention to your nonverbal communication. Once the conversation gets going, you can touch on more personal topics, like hobbies or family. </p>
<p>Now, how do you keep the conversation going? Well, for starters, pick a subject that you've already discussed and ask follow up questions. For example, if the other person wants to pursue a career in computer science, ask questions like how they got there, what do they like about it, or their plans for the near future. Make sure you focus on the conversation and on what the other person has to say rather than on yourself. This will only make it harder to talk, and makes communication ineffective. Remember to pause and let the other person speak and ask questions, too.</p>
<p>Listening and self-expression skills are also crucial for keeping conversations.<br><b>Disarming</b> is a skill that is useful when a discussion gets heated, or even conflictual. To disarm a discussion, make sure to find some truth in what the other person says, even if you don't agree. This helps to show that you are listening and will deescalate the situation.<br>Similarly, <b>paraphrasing</b> what the other person has said can help to show them that you are listening. If you don't understand what the other person is saying, ask a follow-up question to learn more. This will show the other person that you are interested in what they are saying.<br>When conflict is involved, make sure to use <b>"I feel"</b> statements rather than "you" statements.<br>For example, using a "you" statement in a situation may look like, <em>"I hate that you're always late."</em><br>A better alternative may be, <em>"I feel upset when people show up late."</em><br>Using "you" statements will make the other person feel criticized and will put them on the defensive, making communication more difficult.<br>Lastly, you may want to say something <b>positive</b> about the other person in order to show that you value and respect them, even if you are upset at them.</p>

<p><br>As humans, communication is a major part of our everyday lives. Communication allows us to express our feelings or our wants, allows us to strengthen our bonds, and allows us to respect the needs and opinions of others. By working on our key communication skills, which are <strong>Assertiveness, Nonverbal Communication, and Conversational skills</strong>, we are able to communicate as efficiently as possible.</p>
